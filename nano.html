<h1><em>Components of the Web</em></h1>
<p>
Let's take a step back for a second and talk about the major pieces of the web. The major pieces are you, your computer running a web browser, the <span>Internet</span>, and <span>servers</span>.<br><br>

Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers. These requests are using a protocol called HTTP. And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.<br><br>

    Some <b>examples</b> of browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge. You're probably running one of those right this moment.<br><br>

These servers are computers just like yours except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than sitting on your desk browsing these files. And the protocol HTTP is just a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with these servers. We'll mostly be focusing on the browser component in this section for rendering HTML files.
